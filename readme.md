## About this project

This project has two parts:
Client side | Admin side

My focus is on back-end design and logic, so the front-end views look simple.

For client part, the guests can see the blog summary list, read the blogs and contact the author.

For admin part, there is a dashboard, the owner can create, edit, update, delete the blog, create new tags to categorize different kind of content.

This project covers a lot of basic and important concepts of Laravel, such as MVC pattern, Authentication, Eloquent ORM operations, Email Notification, middleware and so on.

How to design the DB and define table relationships is also a big issue during this project. This project really helps me to master Laravel and transfer theory knowledge into practice.
